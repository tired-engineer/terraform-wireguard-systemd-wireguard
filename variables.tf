    List of peers for which to configure a WireGuard mesh.

      * id: Terraform ID of the peer's server resource (on which to trigger replacements)

      * egress: Whether to use this peer for outgoing traffic; i.e. non-egress peers will send all traffic via egress peers

      * endpoint: Public address for other peers to use as its `Endpoint`; may be blank (`""`) if not applicable

      * hostname: The peer's hostname

      * internal_ip: Private IP for this peer in the WireGuard network

      * site_ips: List of IP addresses for this peer's site

      * port: Port on which WireGuard is listening, e.g. `51820`

      * ssh_host: Reachable address to connect to this peer over SSH

      * ssh_user: Username to use in connecting to this peer with SSH

      * ssh_key: Optional private key to use instead of an agent
